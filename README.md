## The Code
This program was written in Java using processing libraries. Throughout the code, we implemented the Priority Queue data structure in order to allow this program to work. The first iteration of this was using Djikstra's algorithm which ran decently fast and well. We then moved it to the A* algorithm which made it run quicker, by narrowing the search algorithm. This program is not perfect, as it can create holes, which the program cannot find a path to.
